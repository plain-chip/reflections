When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    In a team environment. Github allows you to collaborate with others. Keeping work local only allows you to alter the code.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Some changes are not always complete. Manually pulling changes allows for completion before it is public.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Great question.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    Comfort? Always having your master branch stored locally gives peace of mind so you always have a base to build upon.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Ehm.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    Different branches allow for drastic changes to code without altering the master branch in a negative way. If the new branch is
succesful, it can be merged later.

    Forks - copy a repository onto your Github
    Clones - copy a repository onto your computer
    Branches - copy a repository already on your computer and starts a different "head" - i think
